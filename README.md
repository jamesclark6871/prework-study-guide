# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This project took me through the process of creating a webpage using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. The motivation behind the project was to allow me to understand and use the different components needed to create a basic webpage. In doing so I stand in better condition when starting the Bootcamp. I built this project as a space to share what I have learned so far during the prework, allowing others to pick up on notes that they might have missed! I solved various problems throughout this project, including debugging in JavaScript. I have learned so much during the prework, sometimes it was a cognitive overload, but by creating this webpage I am able to save my notes in a secure location.

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will find a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion  on which  topic to study  first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
