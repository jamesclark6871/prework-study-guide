# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
This project took me through the process of creating a webpage using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. The motivation behind the project was to allow me to understand and use the different components needed to create a basic webpage. In doing so I stand in better condition when starting the Bootcamp. I built this project as a space to share what I have learned so far during the prework, allowing others to pick up on notes that they might have missed! I solved various problems throughout this project, including debugging in JavaScript. I have learned so much during the prework, sometimes it was a cognitive overload, but by creating this webpage I am able to save my notes in a secure location.
